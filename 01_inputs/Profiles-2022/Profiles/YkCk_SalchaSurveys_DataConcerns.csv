Years_Affected,Potential_Issue
1993,First year using visual tower count operations to estimate escapement.
1994,"Extreme high water during late June and early July postponed installation of flash panels five days in the Salcha River and eight days in the Chena River from the planned start date of 1 July. Chinook salmon were observed on the first day of counting, (8 July) in the Chena River, but not until the second day of counting (6 July) in the Salcha River."
1996,"Large number of missed counts on both the Salcha and Chena rivers due to high water and poor counting conditions, estimates of total chinook salmon passage were deemed inadequate, and two-sample mark-recapture experiments were conducted as the sole estimate of abundance for each system."
1997,Missed counts were interpolated
1998,"High water due to rainfall prevented counts on 8, 19, 24-26, and 30 July. Missed counts were interpolated."
1999,High water due to rainfall prevented counts on 27-31 July and 9-12 August. Missed counts were interpolated.
2000,"The Salcha River, similar to the Chatanika and Chena rivers, experienced high water and subsequent poor visibility from 11-16 July. Because only five periods were counted during the graveyard shift on 11 July and no counts were conducted during 12-16 July, an expanded estimate for the missing days was calculated using past, complete tower estimates from 1993- 1995 and 1997-1999. The uncertainty of the missing counts is reflected in the relatively large standard error."
2001,"Documented escapement through July 23 (day 19) was estimated to be 9,300 (SE = 322) chinook salmon for the Salcha River (adjusted for three days of missing counts due to high, turbid water). After July 23, an additional 119 chinook salmon were counted. Total escapement, estimated to be 13,328 (SE = 2,163) chinook salmon, was calculated by summing the estimate from count data through 23 July with an estimate of escapement after 23 July based on historical run timing information."
2002,The gaps and questionable counts during the run-up to the probable peak and after make it extremely difficult to develop a point estimate of abundance. Count expanded at a later date. 
2003,High water events impacted counts. Tower count expanded at a later date.
2007 to 2008,High water events impacted counts. Estimates should be considered minimum estimates of escapement.
2009,"BSFA is reporting total estimates of escapement in their annual summary of projects that expand interrupted tower counts greater than 4 days based on different techniques than ADF&G; therefore, total estimates of escapement may differ when the number of days with no counts exceeds 4 days."
2011,Multiple high water events prevented complete counts of the salmon run so estimates were interpolated.
2014,"In 2014, the Salcha River counting tower was not in operation due to multiple high-water events; there are no estimates of Chinook and chum salmon escapement"
2015,A binomial mixed-effects model was used to interpolate the first two weeks of missed counts. No sonar was used.
2020,Project not operated due to funding
2022,"Missed 10 days worth of visual counts due to high water issues. All counts were visual since sonar was not operational. Preliminary count is 1,041 Chinook (SE=57). Run timining model will be aplied to interpolate missed counts."
