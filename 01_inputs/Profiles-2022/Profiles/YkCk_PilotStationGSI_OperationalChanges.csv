2002; 2003,,Pilot Station genetic samples were taken from muscle and fin tissues. Initial investigations of Yukon River genetic population structure were based on information from allozyme data and reporting groups for stock composition estimates were defined using simulated and actual mixtures of Chinook salmon from the Yukon River with the program SPAM (Debevec et al. 2000). Genetic data were collected in the form of individual genotypes inferred from phenotypes observed for 16 enzymes indicating variation at 22 enzyme-encoding loci for an allozyme baseline. Years 2002 and 2003 are original stock composition estimates based on allozymes (Templin et al. 2005).
2004,,"Alternatives to the allozyme baseline and methods were explored (Smith et al. 2005; Templin et al. 2006b; Templin et al. 2006c). No Pilot Station genetic analysis was performed, but Y2 harvest estimates are available in Templin et al. 2006b using a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) baseline of 23 Chinook salmon populations in the Yukon River drainage and 18 SNPs"
2005,,Two types of genetic markers were explored as a replacement to the allozyme baseline: SNPs and microsatellites (Smith et al. 2005; Templin et al. 2006b; Templin et al. 2006c). Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for the 13 microsatellite loci included in the Pacific Salmon Commission standardized database at the time. Stock composition estimates were generated using a baseline of 19 populations and 13 microsatellites using the program SPAM (Debevec et al. 2000; Templin et al. 2006b). 2005 are original estimates based on microsatellites.
2006,,"Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for the 13 microsatellite loci a using a baseline of 19 populations and 13 microsatellites (same methods as 2005). 2006 are original estimates based on microsatellites.In 2006, the SNP baseline was augmented and consisted of 25 populations and 26 SNP markers (Templin et al. 2008). Three additional populations were added for analysis, the Sheenjek and Kantishna rivers from Alaska and the Little Salmon River from the Yukon Territory, Canada. One Canada population was removed from the baseline based on DFO recommendation, Stoney Creek. "
2007-2018,,"2007-2018 Pilot Station test fishery samples were restratified and reanalyzed using the methods and 2014 baseline (36 populations and 42 SNPs) as described above (D. Prince, Fishery Geneticist, ADF&G, Anchorage, personal communication). Original methods and baselines used for a given year are summarized here for context. "
2007,,"In 2007, the SNP baseline was augmented to include additional markers and consisted of 25 populations and 51 SNP markers (DeCovich and Templin 2009). Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for the 26 SNPs used for stock composition estimates in 2006. This reduced set of SNPs, when compared to the original set of 51 SNPs, was determined to provide acceptable levels of accuracy and precision while enabling substantial cost savings (DeCovich and Templin 2009). Fishery stock composition estimates were produced using a baseline of 25 populations and a subset of 26 SNPs."
2008,,"Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for 48 SNPs. However, the same version of the baseline with 26 SNPs used in 2006 and 2007 (DeCovich and Templin 2009; Templin et al. 2008) was used in 2008, and only genotypes from 26 SNPs were used to analyze the fishery samples in 2008 (DeCovich et al. 2010).This reduced set of SNPs, when compared to the original set of 51 SNPs assayed in 2006, was determined to provide acceptable levels of accuracy and precision while providing substantial cost savings (DeCovich and Templin 2009).Fishery stock composition estimates were produced using a baseline of 25 populations and a subset of 26 SNPs."
2009,,"In 2009, the SNP baseline was augmented and consisted of 27 populations and 52 SNPs.  Two additional populations were added to the baseline; the Chatanika River in the Tanana River drainage and a mainstem spawning population collected near Minto. Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for a subset of 42 SNPs from the baseline. More SNPs were assayed in 2009 than in 2008 (26 SNPs) because with advancements in laboratory technology it was no longer cost effective to run only 26 SNPs (DeCovich and Howard 2010). Fishery stock composition estimates were produced using a baseline of 27 populations and a subset of 42 SNPs."
2010,,Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for a subset of 42 SNPs from the 2009 baseline of 27 populations and 52 SNPs (DeCovich and Howard 2011). Fishery stock composition estimates were produced using a baseline of 27 populations and a subset of 42 SNPs.
2011,,"In 2011, the SNP baseline was augmented and consisted of 31 populations and 43 SNPs. Four additional populations were added to the baseline: Morley River, Teslin River, Tincup Creek, and Kandik River.  Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for the 43 SNPs from the baseline."
2012,,Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for the 43 SNPs from the 2011 baseline of 31 populations and 43 SNPs. 
2013,,"In 2013, the SNP baseline was augmented and consisted of 36 populations and 43 SNPs. Five additional populations were added to the baseline: the Nulato River, the Kateel River, the Goodpaster River, the Colleen River, and the Porcupine River. Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for the 43 SNPs using the baseline of 36 populations and 43 SNPs. "
2014-2018,,"In 2014, the SNP baseline was revised to 36 populations and 42 SNPs. This baseline allows 5 reporting groups (Lower Yukon, Koyokuk River, Tanana River, Upper U.S. Yukon, and Canada) to be identified in mixture samples when sample sizes are at least 200 fish (West and Dann 2019). Genetic data were collected from the fishery samples as individual multi-locus genotypes for the 42 SNPs and stock compositions of fishery mixtures were estimated using the program BAYES (Pella and Masuda 2001)."
2019,,Samples from 2019 were summarized using the current 2014 baseline (36 populations and 42 SNPs) and current methods (West and Lee In prep).
2020-2022,,Used the updated Yukon River genetic baseline of 50 Yukon River Chinook salmon populations genetically characterized at 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The 24 markers were identified as part of an R&E funded project to update the Yukon River genetic baseline (URE-163-19).
