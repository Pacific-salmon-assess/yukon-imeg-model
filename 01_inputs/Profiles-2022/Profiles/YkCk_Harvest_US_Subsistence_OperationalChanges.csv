1958-1960,All,"Since 1958, the state of Alaska has collected data on subsistence harvests of Yukon River salmon. Although information is available for 1958-60, the methodologies used in those years have not been documented."
1961,,"Since 1961 Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) staff have conducted subsistence surveys. Subsistence salmon catch data has been collected through personal interviews, catch calendars, and mailed questionnaires. Survey methodologies prior to 1988 were varied, although the basic premise - that surveyors census all known fishing families (groups of households that fished together) in a village - was consistent. An extrapolation method was used to estimate total harvest of all known fishing families."
1970s,,Subsistence fishing permits have been required in three sections of the Upper Yukon area since the early 1970s: (1) the Yukon River near the Yukon River Bridge between Hess Creek and the Dall River; (2) the upper portion of District 5 between the upstream mouth of Twenty-Two Mile Slough and the U.S./Canada border; and (3) the Tanana River near Fairbanks. Beginning in 1988 subsistence permits have been required for the entire Tanana River drainage.
1987,,"Prior to 1987 and in 1991, 1992, and 1994 personal use harvest was considered part of subsistence.  Between 1987 and 1990, personal use fishing was defined by the fisherman's location of residence."
1988,,"New survey methodologies were developed in 1988. The basic methodology developed by the department's Subsistence Division in 1988 was to identify all households in each community and to break the updated community household lists into two strata: usually fish and usually not fished households (Walker et al. 1989). Substantially more fishing households were identified in 1988 than were listed previously. Because the historical survey lists evaluated households in a broader sense (family units working together to harvest and process salmon). there was no direct correlation between fishing family and fishing household. Subsistence catch data has been expanded for non contacted fishing families or households to provide an annual community estimate, and expanded community harvests have been summed for district and total drainage estimates."
1990-1991,,"The stratification system developed by the Subsistence Division was further refined in 1990 and 1991 to improve the accuracy and precision of the drainage-wide subsistence harvest estimate (Holder and Hamner 1991; Bromaghin and Hamner 1993). In 1990 households were classified into one of five catch strata based upon their level of subsistence harvest in 1988 and 1989; in 1991 the strata were based on harvests from 1988, 1989, and 1990. In 1990 fish that were commercially taken but provided both a subsistence and commercial use were assigned to a special category in the Annual Management Reports: the commercial-related salmon harvest."
2020-2022,,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic harvest surveys were conducted remotly via telephone, mail and internet. Electronic versions were of the survey were also used to allow subsistence users to self report harvests online. To improve survey response rate, all know households were attempted to be contacted.
