GoodpasterAerial,Before 1990,"Aerial survey reaches surveyed inconsistent between years and agency responsible. Surveys conducted prior to 1990 were not done consistently and sections surveyed limited.  Aerial Survey sections surveyed, and naming conventions varied between years and not consistent. ADF&G conducted surveys with fixed wing aircraft between 1954, 1960, 1961, 1965,1970 – 1977, 1983 – 1985, 1990 – 1995, 2005 – 2007 and sections surveyed varied. NES conducted surveys with helicopter between 1998 – 2004 and most sections were surveyed. "
