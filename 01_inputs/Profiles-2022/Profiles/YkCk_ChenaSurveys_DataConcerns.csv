Years_Affected,Potential_Issue
1993,First year using visual tower count operations to estimate escapement.
1994,"Extreme high water during late June and early July postponed installation of flash panels five days in the Salcha River and eight days in the Chena River from the planned start date of 1 July. Chinook salmon were observed on the first day of counting, (8 July) in the Chena River, but not until the second day of counting (6 July) in the Salcha River."
1995,"Because of the large number of missed tower counts on the Chena River due to high water and poor counting conditions, the estimate of total chinook salmon passage was deemed inadequate, and a two-sample mark-recapture experiment was conducted to estimate abundance."
1996,"Large number of missed counts on both the Salcha and Chena rivers due to high water and poor counting conditions, estimates of total chinook salmon passage were deemed inadequate, and two-sample mark-recapture experiments were conducted as the sole estimate of abundance for each system."
1997,A Mark/recapture experiment was conducted but the tower count was used as the official estimate of passage. 
1998,"Poor counting conditions prevented counts from being conducted on 9, 10, 15, 18, and 25-28 July. Missed counts were interpolated."
2000,"Heavy rain and subsequent high water and poor visibility prevented counting from 11 through 16 July. An escapement estimate based on tower counts was not possible. Consequently, a mark-recapture experiment was conducted in order to acquire an estimate of total abundance. "
2001,Poor counting conditions prevented counts from being conducted during 8-9 July and on 15 July. Total count includes interpolated estimates for the missed days.
2002,"Complete tower counts were only accomplished during 10 of the 28 days of the run, and the peak of the run was not included. The decision was made to proceed with a mark-recapture experiment to estimate escapement abundance."
2003??,"No interpolation for missed counts, represents a minimum estimate of escapement."
2004,"Because fish were known to have passed upriver during the high smoke conditions, and counting tower operations ceased before the end of the chum salmon run, the 2004 escapement estimates of 9,645 Chinook salmon (SE=532) and 15,162 chum salmon (SE=648) are biased low and considered minimums. Because more than 12 consecutive shifts were missed during the high smoke conditions; the days when counting could not occur were not interpolated for."
2005,"High water events prevented an annual escapement estimate. No mark-recapture experiment was performed in 2005 because although the tower count was a failure, none of the criteria for performing a mark-recapture experiment as described in the methods were met. "
2006,Counts are biased low and considered minimums. Because more than 12 consecutive shifts were missed during the high water conditions; the days when counting could not occur were not interpolated for.
2011,Unable to provide an annual estimate with both the tower and sonar due to high water events.
2012,Majority of daily estimates came from visual tower counts except for July 21 – July 26th which were estimated from sonar.
2013,"Recorded DIDSON images of migrating salmon were collected from 8 July through 4 August. A high water event from 22 July through 23 July prevented tower counts, but this data gap was less than 2 days, and the moving average estimator was used to estimate the daily escapements "
2014,No visual counts. Estimates based on Didson mixture model.
2015,Escapement estimate based on both visual and sonar counts.
2017,"High water events caused an extended period of poor visibility that required the use of sonar technology to estimate fish passage. Postseason, a length-based mixture model was used to apportion sonar targets during the low visibility period and the total was added to expanded visual counts and single days of interpolated data."
2020,"Sustained high water and flood conditions prevented visual counts for the entire season and prevented sonar counts for nearly 60% of the typical counting period. Two ARIS sonars were operational for only 17 days out of approximately a 42-day season. Because of the limited amount of data collected in 2020, this estimate represents a minimum estimate of escapement and is not a total estimate of the escapement. Typically, the Bayesian hierarchical model is used to fill in data gaps. However, the department’s policy has been to limit the use of that model to less than 20% of the reported run (in this case an additional 4 days could be estimated). Since the data collected was such a small portion of the total run (40% of days typically counted), we decided to use only the collected sonar data. After standard sonar apportionment, the minimum estimate of Chinook salmon was 306 (SE = 35) and the minimum, incomplete estimate of chum salmon was 357 (SE = 35; Table 3). Based on run-timing data collected at Pilot Station, it is likely that the Chinook salmon estimate is biased low"
2022,All season based on visual counts. No issues with visability. Sonar was not operational.
