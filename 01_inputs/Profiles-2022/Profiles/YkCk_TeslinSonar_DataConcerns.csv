2012,"The DIDSON was removed on August 19 (no fish counted on the left/south  bank) and the ARIS September 4. No targets were counted on the left/south bank. Following years of sonar indicated that fish passage would be expected on this bank. With a combination of high water flows affecting fish distribution and the likelihood that in 2012 the boom weir on the south bank may not have been completely impervious to fish (page 14, 2015 report) the total count for this year is likely unreliable, and should at the very least be considered a definite underestimate.
