2017,Two short range sonars were deployed.  Due to the steep bank profile it was difficult to achieve an adequate view of the bottom profile on RB.
2017,The sonar began operating two days after peak passage at the Whitehorse Rapids Fishway (located about 20km upstream of the Takhini-Yukon River confluence). A large portion of the run was therefore estimated in a pre-season expansion (29.6%).  The expansion start date applied was the date of first passage through the Fishway.
2017,The RB sonar was aimed downstream towards the weir at an exaggerated 450 angle from shore. As a result the effective range ensonified from shore was reduced to approximately 18m.  The setup and exaggerated angle made it difficult to discern upstream targets and target detection rate may have been low (DFO 2018).
2018,Switched to a single long-range ARIS (1200) sonar.  This sonar was deployed on LB to assess the entire width of the river in two scan ranges (alternating between an inshore and offshore ranges)
2017 and 2018,"The size threshold used to discriminate salmon from freshwater fish was 500mm in 2018, and 600mm in 2017.  However weekly species apportionment (reducing estimates based on large freshwater captures) was applied in both years using the respective thresholds"
