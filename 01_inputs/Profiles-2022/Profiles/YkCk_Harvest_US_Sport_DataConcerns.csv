1977- 1995,Obtaining electronic data prior to 1996 would require ADFG tech support.
1996 – 2018,"Most sportfish harvest within the Yukon drainage occurs within the Tanana River drainage. Survey data is available by survey area (Tanana River drainage (U) and Yukon River drainage (Y)). And further into location within the survey area. Below are tables breaking the harvest into survey area (Table 1) and specific location for the Yukon River drainage survey area (Table 2) from 1996-2018. Of the sportfish harvest in Yukon survey area most was documented downstream of the Koyukuk River. Unfortunately, the survey area is not broken down further to account for tributaries below the Koyukuk except the Anvik. Of the 23 years from 1996 through 2018, 1,972 or roughly 80 fish per year were harvested below the Koyukuk. Main tribs below the Koyukuk are the Anvik, Innoko and the Andreafsky. Most harvest below the Koyukuk is most likely from the Andreafsky. Option 1 - assume all the fish harvested below the Koyukuk is from the Andreafsky and therefore included in harvest below pilot.  The remaining harvest would be broken into Yukon mainstem and Tanana. Option 2  - Assume all sportfish harvest is above Pilot and broken between Yukon mainstem and Tanana. Option 3 - Assume all sportfish harvest is above Pilot and from the Tanana. Although hook and line subsistence is allowed from the mouth of the Yukon River to the Nulato River, subsistence fishing does not require a sport fish license and therefore the SWHS does not record subsistence caught fish.  Also, subsistence fishers using hook-and-line aren’t subject to the bag and possession limits that sport fishers must adhere to.  Consequently, harvest estimates of sport-caught fish from rural Alaska are generally low because local residents usually fish under subsistence regulations."
