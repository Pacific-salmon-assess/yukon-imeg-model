Various,Sonar,Drift netting was attempted to confirm that there was no fish passage in the middle of the river. This could not be confirmed due to difficulties drifting on a sharp bend in a relatively small river (current pushed boat/net onto shore).
2016,Sonar,2 Simrad EK60 split-beam sonars were positioned on the right and left bank. The right bank sonar was able to ensonify ~100m of the river channel and the left bank sonar was able to ensonify ~50m of the river channel resulting in full sonar coverage across the full width of the Pelly River.
2017,Sonar,"1 Simrad EK60 split-beam sonar was positioned on the right bank, and one ARIS Explorer 1800 multi-beam sonar was positioned on the left bank. The right bank sonar ensonifed ~75m of the river channel, while the left bank sonar ensonified ~35m of the river channel."
2018+,Sonar,"1 ARIS Explorer 1200 multi-beam sonar and 1 ARIS Explorer 1800 multi-beam sonar were positioned on the left and right banks, respectively. The left bank sonar ensonified ~60m of the river channel, while the right bank sonar ensonified ~30m of the river channel."
