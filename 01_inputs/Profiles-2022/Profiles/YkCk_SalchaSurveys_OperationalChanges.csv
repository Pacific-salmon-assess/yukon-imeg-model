1987  to 1992 ,MR,"Escapement estimated using a Petersen mark-recapture experiment. This type of experiment required two events. During the first event, a sample of the population was captured, marked, and released back into the population. During the second event, after allowing time for the marked and unmarked fish to mix, another sample was collected and examined for marks."
1987-1994,Other,Potential Egg Production was calculated as a byproduct from the carcass surveys. Fecundity of chinook salmon that returned to the Salcha River was estimated using parameters from a linear regression model that described the relation between fecundity and length (Skaugstad and McCracken 1991).
1993,"Tower, MR",First year using visual tower counting techniques. Chinook and chum salmon were counted during 20 min periods each hour as they passed beneath the Richardson Highway bridge on the Salcha River. Chinook salmon were captured and tagged near Manley on the Tanana River to estimate the migration time to the Salcha and Chena rivers. Four-hundred thirteen chinook salmon were captured and 403 were tagged and released from 12-15 July. The tagged salmon were counted as they passed the counting sites on each river and as they were caught in the commercial and subsistence fisheries
1993 to 2006,Tower,Tower counts were the main method of assessment but a Mark-Recapture experiment was undertaken when an estimate wasn’t possible from tower count methods
1999 to 2015,Tower,"BSFA began contracting with a Fairbanks fisheries consultant to conduct tower counts in 1999. Project mobilization, escapement enumeration, and data analysis procedures for the Salcha River counting tower are virtually identical to those used for the Chena River."
2004 to 2005,Tower,"In 2004, one 12 foot tall tower was erected on the left bank (looking upriver) of the Salcha River approximately 0.25 mile downstream from the Richardson Highway Bridge. In 2005 that site was abandoned due to a deepening channel and increased sport fishing activity. The tower was moved approximately 0.50 mile upstream of the Richardson Highway Bridge and switched to the right bank (looking upriver). "
2015,Tower,BSFA operated the tower. A binomial mixed-effects model was used to interpolate the first two weeks of missed counts. No sonar was used
2016,Tower,"ADF&G took over operation of the project from BSFA. In addition to the counting tower, one DIDSON and one adaptive resolution imaging sonar (ARIS) with a telephoto lens were deployed on the west side near the Salcha River counting tower. Ranges up to 30 m were needed to ensonify the entire river sections"
2019,Tower,"Starting in 2019, changes were implemented in how Division of Sport Fish reported the Chinook and Chum salmon numbers for the Chena and Salcha Rivers inseason. They continued to report the expanded visual counts as usual for Chinook and chum salmon. For days when no visual counts, the top-of-the-hour sonar files were completed and any fish over 650mm (cutoff chosen based on historic length compositions) was considered a Chinook salmon.  Fish that fell below the 650mm cutoff value were considered a mix of kings and chum. The sonar counts were treated like visual counts and expanded for the full hour. The expanded sonar counts for both fish over 650 and fish under 650 were reported on the daily update spreadsheet. These changes dramatically reduced workload and allowed for more immediate data particularly when visual counts are not available. Additionally, final estimates were available shortly after the season ended instead of several months later."
