Years,Component,Change_Event
1956,Whitehorse Dam,Construction of Whitehorse Rapids Hydroelectric Facility begins. 
1958,Whitehorse Dam,Hydroelectric Facility beings producing energy; two turbines.
1969,Whitehorse Dam,Third turbine added to Hydroelectric system.
1984,Hatchery Related,Whitehorse Hatchery begins operations. First year of removal for broodstock
1985,Whitehorse Dam,"Fourth turbine added, known as the ""fourth wheel"", doubling the hydro capacity; between 90-277 cubic m per second pass through depending on electricity generation."
1985,Hatchery Related,Coded Wire Tagging of juveniles (1984 brood year) begins. 
1988,Broodstock,Hatchery Origin Chinook begin to return. Mortality rates in the Fishway begin to be recorded. 
1989 - 1994,Hatchery Related,"Fry were held and fed in the fish ladder for 10 days, and then released in the ladder. This was intended to obtain information on differential mortality depending on release location relative to dam. These may have returned as adults which may have ascended the fish way multiple times in the following years. "
1994 - 1998,Secondary marking,"Secondary marking undertaken to note fish which ascended multiple times and avoid double counting, specifically males. "
1991 - 1994,Adult Counts,No adjustments made to adipose clip tallies (JTC 1998). 
1994 - 1998,Adult Counts,Adipose-clipped counts were expanded by the marked to not-marked release ratios using the age composition of adipose-clipped fish (sexes treated separately) - JTC 1998. 
"1995, 1996",Adult Sampling,Every 10th male and every 10th female Chinook with an adipose clip taken from the ladder for CWT sampling. 
2000,Fishladder Construction,New baffle system installed in the upper (closest to Schwatka) section just below the exit to Schwatka Lake to better control the main attraction flow at the base of the Fishway. This occured after a number of years with high mortality in th upper ladder aera (JTC 2000).  Removable stop blocks allow the inflow depth to adjust in relation to Schwatka lake water levels. 
2000,Fishladder Construction,New baffle system installed in the upper (closest to Schwatka) section just below the exit to Schwatka Lake to better control the main attraction flow at the base of the Fishway.  
2004,Fishladder General,Installation of underwater camera with live feed at base/entrance of ladder. 
2010,Secondary marking,"Subset of salmon given tag, none recovered below the dam or seen again in fish ladder. "
2021,Adult Counts,Installation of video counting system to allow unimpeded salmon passage except for the occurrence of brood stock capture.
