1986 to 1992 ,Method,"Escapement estimated using a Petersen mark-recapture experiment. This type of experiment required two events. During the first event, a sample of the population was captured, marked, and released back into the population. During the second event, after allowing time for the marked and unmarked fish to mix, another sample was collected and examined for marks."
1993,Method,First year using visual counting techniques. Chinook and chum salmon were counted during 20 min periods each hour as they passed beneath the Moose Creek Dam on the Chena River. Chinook salmon were captured and tagged near Manley on the Tanana River to estimate the migration time to the Salcha and Chena rivers. Four-hundred thirteen chinook salmon were captured and 403 were tagged and released from 12-15 July. The tagged salmon were counted as they passed the counting sites on each river and as they were caught in the commercial and subsistence fisheries.
1993 to 2006,Method,Tower counts were the main method of assessment but a Mark-Recapture experiment was undertaken when an estimate wasn’t possible from tower count methods
2007 to present,Method,"Starting in 2007, Dual-frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON) was used to enumerate migrating fish during periods of high-water. A DIDSON was deployed and a mixture model based on length was used to allocate the total count of salmon passing the sonar into numbers of Chinook and chum salmon. Results were compared to actual tower counts and suggested this methodology is an appropriate means to estimate passage when conditions prohibit tower counts. "
2014,Challenge,"No visual counts from towers were possible. two DIDSON (Model 300 short range) transducers were used to enumerate migrating fish and were deployed just upstream of the counting panels. Chinook and chum salmon were estimated using a mixture model with fish length being the discriminating information, weakly informed by run timing. The sonar enumeration methodology was developed and added onto the tower enumeration project as a means to estimate escapement when visual counts were not possible. "
2019,Method,"Starting in 2019, changes were implemented in how sport fish reported the Chinook and Chum salmon numbers for the Chena and Salcha Rivers inseason. They continued to report the expanded visual counts as usual for Chinook and chum salmon. For days when no visual counts, the top-of-the-hour sonar files will be completed and any fish over 650mm (cutoff chosen based on historic length compositions) was considered a Chinook salmon.  Fish that fell below the 650mm cutoff value will be considered a mix of kings and chum. The sonar counts were treated like visual counts and expanded for the full hour. The expanded sonar counts for both fish over 650 and fish under 650 were reported on the daily update spreadsheet. These changes dramatically reduced workload and allowed for more immediate data particularly when visual counts are not available. Additionally, final estimates were available shortly after the season ended instead of several months later."
