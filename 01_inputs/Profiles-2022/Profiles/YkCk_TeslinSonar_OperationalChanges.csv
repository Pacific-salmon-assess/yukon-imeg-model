Years,Component,Change_Event
2011,All,Feasibility year. Suitable sonar site was located and operated for 12 days  with DIDSON sonars and no deflection fences. Carcass pitch was completed. 
2012- 2013,Sonar Units,An ARIS sonar unit was deployed from the north bank  of the river and a DIDSON sonar was deployed on the left (south) bank. 
2012,Fish deflection,"Fish deflection on both banks fences were constructed from floating boom logs, which suspended wire fencing weighed down by rocks (boom weir). May not have been completely impervious to fish (page 14, 2015 report)"
2012,Missing Files,"During any downtimes, potentially missed fish were added to the counts by extrapolation based on the mean number of fish per hour recorded the previous 24 hours. "
2013-2015,Recounts ,"8-10% of the sonar files were recounted each day to measure the precision of counts, using methods described above. "
2013-2014,Fish deflection ,"North (RIGHT??) bank weir was constructed from metal tripods, wooden stringers, and conduit. South bank remained a boom weir. "
2014-2015,Sonar Units,"Two ARIS 1800 units used, one on each bank. "
2015,Fish deflection,Fence panels used in conjunction with boom weir on south bank (river left) - lower water levels than previous years made placement and maintenance easier. 
2013-2015,Missing Files ,Missing counts calculated based on the mean number of fish per hour counted 12 hours before and after the outage. When complete files were missed the Chinook passage was estimated by interpolation of the average file count over the 12 hour period before and after the missing sample event.
2015,End of season extrapolation ,"First year where last day of counts over 15 salmon (n = 33). Last five days of sonar counts used to calculate a logarithmic regression formula for the end of season expansion, adding 60 fish to the final count over five days. "
2022,All,Test sonar was run this summer
