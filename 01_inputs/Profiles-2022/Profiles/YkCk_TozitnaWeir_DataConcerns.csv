Years_Affected,Potential_Issue
"2002 - 2004, 2006 - 2008","Increased discharge in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008 affected operation of the weir, either forcing the crew to let fish pass undetected for a matter of hours or days and interpolate data later or to pull the project completely before salmon escapement had been satisfactorily enumerated. Only in 2005 and 2009 were complete counts of both summer chum and Chinook salmon achieved."
2003,No interpolation was done for missing days of counts.
2004,High stream discharge from the period of 1 to 3 August prevented counting and biological sampling; counts were interpolated for this period.
2006,Count is considered incomplete due to a 6 day period of missing counts during high stream discharge.
2008,In 2008 heavy rain in the upper Tozitna River watershed forced closure of the fish trap at 2100 on 2 August after the weir panels became submerged until 1030 on 5 August.
