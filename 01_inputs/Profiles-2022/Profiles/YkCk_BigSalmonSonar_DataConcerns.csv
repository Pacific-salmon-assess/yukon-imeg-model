2005-2006,"The resolution of target images at ranges 25 - 40 m was described as poor and the relative size of the targets beyond this distance could only be determined qualitatively; however, the authors suggest Chinook salmon were readily distinguishable from resident fish species by the relative size of the image and difference in swimming behavior. In 2009 the addition of an 8° concentrator lens further improved visibility in the outer range."
2007,"Sudden high water event collapsed north bank (river right) weir on August 8, reinstalled August 11 when water levels dropped sufficiently. Although lower passage was observed August 8, it was presumed to be from increased discharge, not missed fish. "
2008,"High water affected 2008 operations. From July 13 - July 20, the sonar was in a protected eddy, then moved to the usual location July 21. Weir structures for fish deflection were not completed until August 9. The first salmon target was observed July 19.  A comparison was made of the proportion of Chinook migrating in the 5 to 10 m range and the 40 to 45 m range both before and after the partial weirs was installed, and there was an increase of 21% in these areas. This expansion was applied to August 9, adding 102 salmon, an increase to the total count of 7.8%. This estimate is believed to be biased low due to missed fish, and comparison in order of magnitude to Eagle GSI proportions, its use is not recommended. "
