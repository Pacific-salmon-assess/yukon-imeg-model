2014 - Current,All,"Beginning in 2014, the Yukon Management Area’s Coastal District was included to provide a more complete estimate of Yukon River Chinook salmon harvest by stock and age and to be consistent with information used by ADF&G for determining total run and harvest shares of the Canadian-origin stock component. "
1982 - 2000,Subsist.,"Sample collections occurred in Y4, Y5, and Y6 for estimating age composition.  	Y4 collections occurred in 14 of 18 years, Y5 in 8 years, and Y6 in 10 years."
2001 - 2018,Subsist.,"Subsistence harvest sampling expanded to include lower river districts Y1–Y3. Y1 collections occurred in 15 of 18 years, Y2 in 6 years (since 2011), and Y3 in 9 years."
2011 - 2018,Subsist.,"Subsistence sampling methods were refined beginning in 2011. Community members were recruited and trained on how to take age, sex, length, and genetic samples from their subsistence-caught Chinook salmon, and they were paid for each sample collected. Participants were asked to sample their entire Chinook salmon harvest. The study design assumed that a well distributed grab sample from volunteer participants resulted in a representative dataset that was “self-weighted” to the actual distribution of harvest across gear, time, and location of harvest. Sample collection and processing details are described in annual reports. "
2018,Subsist.,"Sample collections from the Coastal District were attempted, but largely unsuccessful. "
1980 - 2003,SPA,SPA was used to apportion harvest to geographic stock of origin 
1980 - 1996,SPA,Estimates of stock composition for major age classes used nearest neighbor analysis (NNA; 1980–1982)) or a linear discriminant function (LDF; 1983–1996) model. Each method was used in combination with observed age composition ratios among escapements to estimate stock composition of minor age classes. NNA was selected in early years because it was nonparametric and many of the scale characteristics used in the analyses were not normally distributed. LDF was used following a selection of new scale characteristics and data transformations which were approximately normally distributed. The two methods produced comparable results
1997 - 2003,SPA,A maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model was developed to estimate stock composition more efficiently for major age classes. The MLE model was used in combination with observed age composition ratios among escapements to estimate stock composition of minor age classes. 
2000,SPA,Historical estimates from 1982–1996 were revised using the MLE method (Lingnau 2000)
2004 - 2022,GSI,GSI methods replaced SPA for stock separation.
2004 - 2022,GSI,"Stock composition of Y5 harvests were apportioned as a mixed stock using GSI methods instead of assuming the entire harvest was comprised of the upper stock group, as was done in prior years."
2004 - 2006,GSI,"GSI methods were only used to estimate the stock composition of the major age classes harvested in mixed-stock fisheries. Like prior years, the proportions of minor age classes were estimated from age composition ratios among escapements, in combination with genetic estimates for analogous age classes."
2007 - 2022,GSI,GSI methods were used exclusively to estimate stock of origin from samples (i.e. regardless of age) collected directly from mixed-stock harvests.
2004 - 2014 ,GSI,"genetic baselines varied, generally increasing the number of populations and markers: For details, refer to Pilot Station GSI Appendix"
2020,GSI,Updated Yukon River genetic baseline of 50 Yukon River Chinook salmon populations genetically characterized at 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The 24 markers were identified as part of an R&E funded project to update the Yukon River genetic baseline (URE-163-19).
