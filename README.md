# yukon-imeg-model

Repository for generating run-reconstructions for lower, middle, and upper (Canadian) Yukon River Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*) stock aggregates as well as biological reference points for the Canadian stock. Estimates are based on an integrated state-space run reconstruction and spawner-recruitment model fit to data (1981-2022) from various assessment projects that estimate mainstem passage, harvests, tributary escapements, stock-proportions, and age-composition, under a single Bayesian estimation framework. 

Full model details are described in:
